 *
 * 1 dimensional tilt sensor using a dual axis accelerometer
 * and single axis angular rate gyro.  The two sensors are fused
 * via a two state Kalman filter, with one state being the angle
 * and the other state being the gyro bias.
 *
 * Gyro bias is automatically tracked by the filter.  This seems
 * like magic.
 *
 * Please see the file tilt.c for more details on the implementation.
 * This header only has comments for the use of the module, not the
 * inner workings.
