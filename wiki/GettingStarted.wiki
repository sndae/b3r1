# Getting Started with the code on this site   

SVN=How to get started with the b3r1 project.=
The B3R1 is a self balancing two wheeled robot that uses the AVRbutterfly micro controller and the WinAVR development environment. This project provides code for the flutterbot

You will need several thing to get started.

    * AVR Butterfly
    * in WinAVR - I suggest you google "WinAVR" and download the version for your computer
    * AVRStudio - I suggest you google "AVRStudio" and download the version for your computer
    * subversion client. We suggest TortoiseSVN http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads 

TottoiseSVN comes with a good manual. Anyone want to set up a sandbox?
    * OK I know that you didn't read the manual so here is a list of the next steps. It is just a rough list don't blame me if you can't get it to work without reading the manual.
    * Create a file on your computer. I called mine "My SVN"
    * Right click on the file 
    * Select "SVN Checkout"
    * Non-members paste "http://b3r1.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"

==Adding a Folder to the repository==
    * This is not needed if you are only adding a file.
    * It is probably best to start with your folders synchronized with the repository. 
    * On your computer create the folder
    * Go up one level to the parent folder and right-click.
    * Select TortoiseSVN and select "add" 
    * Select TortoiseSVN again and select commit
